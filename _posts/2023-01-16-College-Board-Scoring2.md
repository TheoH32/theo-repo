| Program Function and Purpose | 0             | 0                   | No explanation of program functionality at all, alone is 0                                 |
| Data Abstraction             | 0             | 0                   | Explanations were bare or misleading as it did not go along with funtion and list purpose  |
| Managing Complexity          | 0             | 0                   | Barely if any complexity that helped this code segment                                     |
| Procedural Abstraction       | 0             | 0                   | Fidn't describe procedure even though it is included with the code                         |
| Algorithm Implementation     | 0             | 0                   | Used iteration, selection, and sequencing but didn't say how they used it                  |
| Testing                      | 0             | 1                   | I thought testing and explanations were minimal but College Board passes it off as a point |
