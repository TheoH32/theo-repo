# Quiz App

<a href="https://studio.code.org/projects/applab/vwRh3GInnZlL7b4wTEiEcF6Qu07NAd8CAB9eNlNQCMY/edit/#">App</a>

## Brainstorming
App Ideas
- Animals
- Cities
- Superheros
- Sports
- Celebs

## Goals
From a general standpoint of brainstorming, I have a basis of what I want to do. I want to make a game centered around guessing the superhero centered in the middle of the screen. Beforehand, there should be a title screen with somewhat of an appealing design and a start button. The start button when clicked should lead to the first testing screen. From the first screen, a picture of a hero will show up and you have to input your answer into the text box. The answers should be varying from tester to tester so there should be many applicable answers that should work but varying on spelling and such. Example: Iron Man/Iron man/iron man/ironman and so on. Each quiz screen should lead to one another in order. After the three questions, the user should be greeted with a victory screen. The victory screen should state the score, a message, and a restart button.

## Final Statement
After a while of trying out many things and experimenting, my quiz is complete. I have created multiple stages of questions involving the user to guess the superhero shown. If the user correctly inputs the names, they will be taken to the next screen. If they are stuck, there is a restart button on each stage of the quiz which brings you to a screen where you either confirm that you want to go back to the main menu or go back to the stage of the quiz you were on. After completing every question, a victory screen will pop up showing the score and having a button to reroute you to the main menu. This menu or title screen has two playable apps. The quiz which is being described here, and a clicking game which is explained lower.

# Clicking App

## Brainstorming
 - Time factor
 - Every click shows up on screen
 - "x clicks in y seconds"

 ## Goals
 I want to make a clicking game that is based off how fast you can click something. My main idea is having the goal of 50 clicks and seeing how fast you can do it. After 50 clicks a message will pop up saying how fast you did it.

 ## Final Statement
 After messing around with it a bit, I changed how I wanted the game to work. I reverse my logic and now its how fast you can get to x amount of clicks. First I set all the time and score variables to zero, then after the first click on the image, the time starts counting away and the click count is dependant on the user. I put a dinosaur as the image you have to click and the goal is to see how fast you can get to 50 clicks. There is a label that shows how many clicks you have until you get to 50. Also added a back arrow to get to the homescreen.
