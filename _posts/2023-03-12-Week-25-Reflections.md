# Big Ideas

## Pandas
### The way pandas works is sorting data through columns and rows. Then based on user code, it takes that data and displays it through a table.

## Changing pixels
### The way I accomplished certain scales was through changing the RBG values. Pixel one has the red values, 2 is the green, 3 is the green. Changing all of the them changes the black and white. But altering one is supersaturating the values and creating a filter almost.

## Project Inclusion
### Since python is not compatible with the languages I used, css is needed for a grey scale.
