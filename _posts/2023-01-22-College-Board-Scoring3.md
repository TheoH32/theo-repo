### Video showed good function and purpose even while being somewhat short. Response has two code  segments which either stores game possibilites or code needed for decision making. However the second code segment needed to connect with the stored data that was inputed with the user. The program does not manage complexity because it is written to do the same thing in a different way. With procedures, the coder fails to explain how the made procedure benefits the program functionality. Coder uses iteration, selection, and sequencing. Finally, the testing was done properly with trying multipal conditionals.

### Shows program functionality and the purpose of the code, and shows meaning of inputs and outputs. Two separate code segments are shown which one stores user inputted data and the other accesses it. I didn't think it managed complexity right but College Board disagrees with me because there would be no other efficient way to replicate this. Student has guessWords, a developed procedure, which is also explained in the written response as to its functionality. guessWords uses sequencing, selection, and iteration. Student testing follows all parameters with different conditions tested.

### Describes functionality with inputs and outputs, also has program purpose in the response. Stored data from user is not being called at all. I thought it managed complexity but College Board says the explanation is very generic and could have gone into more detail. The response doesnt explain student made procedure yet does the video call it. I was mistaken because I thought there was sequencing, selection, and iteration, but there was no iteration.

### Has functionality and purpose, and shows possible input and output situations. Two code segments which store and access data in accordance. Manages complexity with a detailed response and explanation stating how it cannot be replicated simpler. Has a student procedure which is explained and uses sequencing, iteration, and selection. Testing is not absolute and doesnt show meaningful parameters.
