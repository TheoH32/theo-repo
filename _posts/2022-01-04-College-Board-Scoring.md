# College Board Scoring

| Reporting Catergory          | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Program Purpose and Function | 0             | 0                   | Didn't fully explain what the function did, "provides information" does not give me detail of what the output is going to be.                                  |
| Data Abstraction             | 1             | 1                   | Stores user inputed data in sideIndex and provides the list back along with explanations back.                                                                 |
| Managing Complexity          | 1             | 0                   | I thought the list of the inputted side lengths would count but College Board explains how the way the coder managed complexity was inefficient and uneccesary |
| Procedural Abstraction       | 1             | 1                   | Describes and shows the function of the user made procedure                                                                                                    |
| Algorithm Implementation     | 1             | 1                   | Uses sequencing, iteration, and selection while also meeting the other requirements                                                                            |
| Row 6 Testing                | 1             | 1                   | Identifies results, has two calls to ratioCalculate, and checks ABC                                                                                            |
