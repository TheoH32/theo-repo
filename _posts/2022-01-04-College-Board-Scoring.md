# College Board Scoring

| Reporting Catergory          | Student Score | College Board Score | Comments                                                                                                                                                       |
|------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Program Purpose and Function | 0             | 0                   | Didn't fully explain what the function did, "provides information" does not give me detail of what the output is going to be.                                  |
| Data Abstraction             | 1             | 1                   | Stores user inputed data in sideIndex and provides the list back along with explanations back.                                                                 |
| Managing Complexity          | 1             | 0                   | I thought the list of the inputted side lengths would count but College Board explains how the way the coder managed complexity was inefficient and uneccesary |
| Procedural Abstraction       | 1             | 1                   | Describes and shows the function of the user made procedure                                                                                                    |
| Algorithm Implementation     | 1             | 1                   | Uses sequencing, iteration, and selection while also meeting the other requirements                                                                            |
| Row 6 Testing                | 1             | 1                   | Identifies results, has two calls to ratioCalculate, and checks ABC values                                                                                           |

|------------------------------|---------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Program Purpose and Function | 1             | 1                   | Shows input, output, and describes functionality and purpose                      |
| Data Abstraction             | 1             | 1                   | Shows both data storing and usage in two functions, and fulfilling variable names |
| Managing Complexity          | 0             | 1                   | I was confused on the list functionality and how it managed complexity            |
| Procedural Abstraction       | 1             | 1                   | Describes and shows usage of both code segments                                   |
| Algorithm Implementation     | 1             | 1                   | Self made algorithm that uses iteration, selection, and sequencing                |
| Row 6 Testing                | 1             | 1                   | Descries and identifying results and segments                                     |
