# Citizen Science Approach
### Having a group analyzing rather than a small analysist team

# TCP and IP
### TCP is the process which lets packets of data transfer over the internet. The IP address breaks the packets and sends them while the other IP assembles them.

# O(n)
### Reasonable time algorithms are used to reflect on input to running time of an algorithm

# IPv6
### Internet Protocol is the method to route data packets on the internet, which is also designed to upscale at the size of how many users there are on the Internet

# IPv6 vs TCP
### IPv6 is used to route the packets while TCP is used to make sure its transmitted reliable and in the right order

# Generalization
### To generalize features means to extend the usage and handle both parameters. The generalization of function 1 and function 2 could be function 3 while handles both function 1 and 2.

# Lossless
### Can be compressed but not downsized in quality

# Algorithm and Problems
### There are some problems that algorithms CANNOT solve

# Bits
### a sequence of bits can represent an integer, alphanumeric character, and a machine language instruction

# Symmetric encryption
### symmetric encryption is one key used for encryption and decryption

# Round-off vs Overflow errors
### Overflow is when it the number exceeds the amount possible by bits, round off is when the precision differed per number of bits

# When NOT to use simulations
# When the solution your looking for requires real world intervals

# Public keys
# Public key encryption is a secure method of traversing through the Internet

# Data packets
# They are broken up and CAN be sent in different paths

# Networking redundancy
### Allows the connection to retry under the attempt it fails, like a Faraday gem

# Internet vs WWW
# Internet is a network while World Wide Web is a system of linked pages
