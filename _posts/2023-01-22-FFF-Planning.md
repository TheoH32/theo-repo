## What I need

- purpose and function
- list and elements in list
- managing complexity
- developing a procedure
- Implementing selection, iteration, sequencing
- testing


## My Part
### What I picked for my project is a personality or matching quiz that matches unit input to a dog that meets their needs. How this is gonna work is having a user list with attributes of the dogs listed. User input will be stored and will cross-match the user list attributes, from there, an algorithm will pick the best one and show the user. An after screen should pop up and have a final summary for the user.

## Diving Deeper
### The user list will be stored in a flask, called upon by a front-end user input on fastpages, and deployed with AWS.

## How I'm going to meet requirements
### purpose and function: To match up dogs and people around the world, functions by flask backend usage, AWS deployment, and front end calling
### list and elements in list: List is all the dogs, elements are dog attributes
### managing complexity: Honestly have no idea how I am going to do this, will ask in class because I am still fuzzy in this area
### developing a procedure: The procedure will be the list/user input matching portion of the project
### implementing selection, iteration, sequencing: Selecting a user from the user list will be selection. Repeating calls to display different questions to the user can take care of iteration. The order of sequencing will be display question, get input, fetch backend, deployment, crossmatching, and finally displaying the final result.
### testing: Having a video showing inputs, outputs, and the general requirements
