# Main takeaways
- Teachers should put less of a workload onto students as it causes stress
- Students should be taught methods of success, however, the student has to be just as willing to accept the help as it is given to them
- Students have to be able to be open-minded to having that growth mindset in order to become more academically ready
- Everyone has a different path
- Other students are learning just as much as you, don't compare yourself to anyone
- Other students are struggling too, ask for help among your peers
