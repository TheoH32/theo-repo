# Q7
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/QQQ7.png)
## Correct Answer: You don't technically need the phone number to redirect them to a help center, I thought it meant storing # in database for later

# Q22
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/QQQ22.png)
## Correct Answer: Grid 2 does not work with the selected function. Grid 2 will be stuck at the end because the robot will turn right as that is the first action called upon in the procedure.

# Q24
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/QQQ24.png)
## Correct Answer: Honestly, I'm a bit confused by this. The only way I could've solved this was realizing the other ones DO work as intended. Not sure what the explanation means entirely.

# Q28
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/QQQ28.png)
## Correct Answer: B does not work because you need a temporary placeholder to find the length of characters you need to remove. B would only remove the last two and not the first two.

# Q29
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/QQQ29.png)
## Correct Answer: Was not familiar with the NOT, AND, and OR operators. After research, a should be FALSE which then changes the answer from c to be FALSE as well.

# Q32
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/QQQ32.png)
## Correct Answer: Did not account that minimum needs to be updated, my selected answer replaces instead of updates the list.

# Q38
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/QQQ38.png)
## Correct Answer: My answer does not account that if the number is 0, it will never display the intended output as the ELSE statement before it will display "positive". Have the positive and zero in one ELSE + ELSE will take it down the correct determination.

# Q39
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/QQQ39.png)
## Correct Answer: Putting the count code between 6 and 7 will count every time it moves forward rather then my answer where it will count half as much.

# Q41
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/QQQ41.png)
## Correct Answer: Decimal numbers don't change the problem at all, sorting however is required for a binary search.

# Q49
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/QQQ49.png)
## Correct Answer: I honestly don't know why I picked this answer. It makes no sense to be fair. A model can always be changed from a simulation stand point. Details will be omitted after the simulation is done.

# Q50
![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/QQQ50.png)
## Correct Answer: B is not correct because it does not follow a linear step slope. B increases exponentially while A follows a linear +10 path.
