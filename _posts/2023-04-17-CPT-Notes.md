## Procedural Abstraction
### Procedures are functions with defined parameters that change the course of how they run. In my project, the parameter was based on whether the boolen variable was true or false, and based on that changed the outcome of the procedure.

## Data Abstraction
### Data abstraction is used in some instances to sort and take data throughout code. In my CPT, I defined and sorted data through a list. Than, I abstracted one value and used it as to define an answer variable.

## Control Structures and conditional statements
### Control structures and conditional statements are essential to major projects. I used iteration for the guessing aspect of my game, only stopping when there were too many tries or when the answer was guessed. Selection was  used to see if the right answer was guess. Sequencing was used to take a value from a list and define it as the answer.
