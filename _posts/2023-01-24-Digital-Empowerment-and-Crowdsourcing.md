# Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
### Three beneficial effects of computing are advancements in medical fields, better ways of analyzing data, and more processes of communicating over distances. Three harmful effects are the it can imbalance your dopamine, take away jobs from real people, and can cause an addiction in many ways for people.


# Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
### Even from a personal account, I can say dopamine is a real issue. With new apps that use intricate algorithms, I feel like anything compared to it is anything but substantial. I had to delete TikTok because I felt like anything that wasn't a 30 second video wasn't worth my time and/or I didn't care about it, and of course I found myself wondering how I had spent hours scrolling. I've been through the rabbit hole of technology addiction which is why I mostly cut myself off from a lot of it. I stopped using my phone before bed, limit my hours on my phone, and try my best to enjoy the moments that I can have in real life.

# How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
### Personally I think just research. Research is how I empower my knowledge regarding anything I inquire about. Digital empowerment does however have many different meanings. If not regarding knowledge, it can be about power. Digital power can be obtained through various methods with various meanings however.

# How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
### There are multiple ways at Del Norte. First, I am apart of National Honors Society, Link Crew, and other clubs that all have the sole purpose of helping other people. Each club has their own unique way of giving assistance to those who need it. National Honors Society requires 40 hours of community service from each of its members meaning that the club itself has given thousands of hours to the community over the years. Link Crew helps freshman every year settle into Del Norte.

# Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
### I think it's a bit of both. There are hardline rules in parallel with soft barriers everywhere you go. In Del Norte, there are you must rules but then their soft in other areas too. For example, racism is a hard no which is heavily punished. A soft example is vaping where the school can't do a whole lot because they can only catch you outside the bathroom and/or with search you with evidence. It is kinda annoying dealing with false fire alarms and crowded bathrooms due to a problem that cannot easily be dealt with.

# Computing Bias
### Bias in the computer would can be interpreted in many ways. Things like TikTok are altered towards young audiences which have algorithms that influence young minds with these short videos. The algorithm stores what interests you have and shows you videos that will interest you, hence why many are turning towards the app in any amount of free time they have. However, Facebook, takes another route. They have routed towards another audience. Their older audience simply can be hooked on groups or articles. A completely different source of media but towards the same objective.

# CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
### A croudsource idea for the students should be something revolving a general consistence of education. Something regarding computer science would be a great idea because it would be a topic familiar with the audience. Also this would prevent feeding info that wouldn't produce what the subject is for. An example would be if you crowdsourced the principle students for a topic like "how have you felt racism impact you in the work environment". Not only would their people who have not worked, but the topic is completely irreverent to the crowd

# What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing?
### Del Norte crowdsouring does provide sufficient data depending on what your project is. There is a variety of cultures and people but all with the common knowledge of education. However, my project doesn't really benefit as much as others would from crowdsourcing. My project results would vary but the product itself wouldn't be helped much.

# What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week.
### Data that I could capture is what type of dog that people generally gravitate towards. I'm guessing a majority of people will go towards a quiet but playful house dog. Or maybe the data will be more spread out, only the final results could really say. With such data, I would maybe make a pie chart or table with the majority of wants from the inputs.
