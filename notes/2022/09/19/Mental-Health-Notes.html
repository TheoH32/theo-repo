<ul>
  <li>Teachers should put less of a workload onto students as it causes stress</li>
  <li>Students should be taught methods of success, however, the student has to be just as willing to accept the help as it is given to them</li>
  <li>Students have to be able to be open-minded to having that growth mindset in order to become more academically ready</li>
  <li>Everyone has a different path</li>
  <li>Other students are learning just as much as you, don’t compare yourself to anyone</li>
  <li>Other students are struggling too, ask for help among your peers</li>
</ul>
