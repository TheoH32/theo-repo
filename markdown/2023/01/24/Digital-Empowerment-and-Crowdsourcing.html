First, I am apart of National Honors Society, Link Crew, and other clubs that all have the sole purpose of helping other people. Each club has their own unique way of giving assistance to those who need it. National Honors Society requires 40 hours of community service from each of its members meaning that the club itself has given thousands of hours to the community over the years.

There are hardline rules in parallel with soft barriers everywhere you go. In Del Norte, there are you must rules but then their soft in other areas too. For example, racism is a hard no which is heavily punished. A soft example is vaping where the school can’t do a whole lot because they can only catch you outside the bathroom and/or with search you with evidence. It is kinda annoying dealing with false fire alarms and crowded bathrooms due to a problem that cannot easily be dealt with.</a></li>

Things like TikTok are altered towards young audiences which have algorithms that influence young minds with these short videos. The algorithm stores what interests you have and shows you videos that will interest you, hence why many are turning towards the app in any amount of free time they have. However, Facebook, takes another route. They have routed towards another audience. Their older audience simply can be hooked on groups or articles. A completely different source of media but towards the same objective.</a></li>

Something regarding computer science would be a great idea because it would be a topic familiar with the audience. Also this would prevent feeding info that wouldn’t produce what the subject is for. An example would be if you crowdsourced the principle students for a topic like “how have you felt racism impact you in the work environment”. Not only would their people who have not worked, but the topic is completely irreverent to the crowd</a></li>

First, I am apart of National Honors Society, Link Crew, and other clubs that all have the sole purpose of helping other people. Each club has their own unique way of giving assistance to those who need it. National Honors Society requires 40 hours of community service from each of its members meaning that the club itself has given thousands of hours to the community over the years. Link Crew helps freshman every year settle into Del Norte.</h3>

There are hardline rules in parallel with soft barriers everywhere you go. In Del Norte, there are you must rules but then their soft in other areas too. For example, racism is a hard no which is heavily punished. A soft example is vaping where the school can’t do a whole lot because they can only catch you outside the bathroom and/or with search you with evidence. It is kinda annoying dealing with false fire alarms and crowded bathrooms due to a problem that cannot easily be dealt with.</h3>

Things like TikTok are altered towards young audiences which have algorithms that influence young minds with these short videos. The algorithm stores what interests you have and shows you videos that will interest you, hence why many are turning towards the app in any amount of free time they have. However, Facebook, takes another route. They have routed towards another audience. Their older audience simply can be hooked on groups or articles. A completely different source of media but towards the same objective.</h3>

Something regarding computer science would be a great idea because it would be a topic familiar with the audience. Also this would prevent feeding info that wouldn’t produce what the subject is for. An example would be if you crowdsourced the principle students for a topic like “how have you felt racism impact you in the work environment”. Not only would their people who have not worked, but the topic is completely irreverent to the crowd</h3>
