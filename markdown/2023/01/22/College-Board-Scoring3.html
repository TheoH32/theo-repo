Response has two code  segments which either stores game possibilites or code needed for decision making. However the second code segment needed to connect with the stored data that was inputed with the user. The program does not manage complexity because it is written to do the same thing in a different way. With procedures, the coder fails to explain how the made procedure benefits the program functionality. Coder uses iteration, selection, and sequencing.
