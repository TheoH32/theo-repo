This demonstrates API usage with get and post methods to get the individual scores and post it on users pages. As a bonus, it also engages the users as many have a urge to be on top. This brings repeatability to their website. After looking at their API, you can see all the ID, score, and password usage. They also have methods to filter garbage API input.</a></li>
